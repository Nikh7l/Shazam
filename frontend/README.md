# Shazam Clone - Frontend

This is the React frontend for the Shazam Clone project. It provides the user interface for recording audio, viewing match results, and managing the song database.

## Setup

These instructions assume you are in the `frontend` directory.

1.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

## Running the Development Server

To start the Vite development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`. The server will automatically reload when you make changes to the code.

## Building for Production

To create a production-ready build:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create an optimized build of the application in the `dist` directory.
